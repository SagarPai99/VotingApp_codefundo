# CodeFunDo IDEA

## ABSTRACT
Voting is perhaps the most important thing a citizen can do to support their democratic form of government. By voting, a person is more likely to get elected officials who will listen to the voices of the people they represent. According to Stanford University, political scientists Adam Bonica and Michael McFaul, there is a consensus among political scientists that "Democracies perform better when more people vote."

Though there has been an increase in awareness of the importance of voting, the voter turnout has not shown any significant improvements. One of the major reasons for voters to not vote on the election day, especially in the urban areas is the temptation of the polling holiday providing an extra long weekend.Especially when voters are living away from their constituency, they tend to think that their efforts to go back and vote will be futile.

## CONCEPT
The aim of this idea is to create an application which helps in easing the process of an election. We have come up with an idea of creating an application where a voter could vote online (through any booth) securely even though the person lives in some other location and not close to his/her voting booth. Our records of the voters list will be stored on a blockchain and will allow the voter to vote only once.The casted vote will be stored securely by implementing the concepts of blockchain. This application created will help in tallying the votes and publishing the results as soon as the voting process has ended.

## USES OF OUR SOLUTION

Blockchain will ensure that the data is secure and also protect the privacy of the voter.
Blockchain database security will prevent hacking of the database thus avoiding modifications/tampering of candidates votes.
Publishing of the results instantaneously after the voting for the day has ended will reduce a lot of days and human effort in counting and tallying of the votes.

## TECHNOLOGY STACK
- Microsoft Azure Blockchain will be used to deploy the blockchain.
- Smart Contracts will be written using Solidarity language .
- Web3js will be used to develop the frontend User Interface.
- Ethereum will be used.
- Nodejs, jQuery and Bootstrap will be used for interfacing and UI.
